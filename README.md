I wanted to be able to run on my raspberrypi the kickass Parity but there was no binary available (and compiling was slow and tricky).
So, I compiled my own pipeline to do this so you don't have to :D

I'll try to always patch and compile the latest version so it works for RaspberryPI.

Bug me [@jonromero](http://twitter.com/jonromero) to update to the latest binary version.
