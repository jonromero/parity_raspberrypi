**Parity Binary file for RaspberryPI**

I wanted to be able to run on my raspberrypi the kickass [Parity](https://ethcore.io/parity.html) but there was no binary available (and compiling was slow and tricky). 
So, I made my own pipeline to do this so you don't have to :D

Make sure you read how to [sync](https://github.com/ethcore/parity/wiki/Getting-Synced) and you'll have your raspberrypi synced in ~30 minutes.

I'll try to always patch and compile the latest version so it works for RaspberryPI.

Get the binary [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/757245/parity).

Bug me [@jonromero](http://twitter.com/jonromero) to update to the latest binary version.
